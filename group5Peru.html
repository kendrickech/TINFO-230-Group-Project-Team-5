    <p class="text">
        Peru's rich history has been shaped by numerous civilizations and significant events. The
      region was home to ancient cultures, such as the Norte Chico civilization and the Nazca.
      However, the most prominent and well-known of these civilizations was the Inca Empire, which
      emerged in the 15th century. It was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America and has gained
      global attention due to its advanced agricultural practices and the scenic ruins of Machu
      Picchu. <br><br>
      In 1532, conquistadors from Spain, led by Francisco Pizarro, conquered the Inca Empire,
      leading to centuries of colonial rule. During this time period, indigenous and Spanish cultures
      would blend together, significantly influencing Peru's language, religion, and traditions.
      Peru gained independence from Spanish rule on July 28th, 1821. After gaining independence, Peru
      faced political instability and territorial conflicts, but has since evolved into a vibrant
      nation known for its cultural heritage, natural beauty, and flavorful cuisine. Today, Peru
      celebrates its rich history while embracing modernity, making it a fascinating destination for
      travelers.

    <h3>Places to Visit</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="content_box">
    <h4>Machu Picchu</h4>
    <div class="content_left">
    <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/k/c69e6e4e-bd6b-4909-833d-55492fdb7c3e/Machu-Picchu_Inca_KIDS_0323.jpg" class="peru_photo_left" alt="Machu Picchu"/>
    <p class="text">
        Built in the 15th century, Machu Picchu is often referred to as the “Lost City of the Incas”
      and is one of the most visited historical sites of the world. It was built under the reign of
      Emperor Pachacuti around 1450 and is believed to have been abandoned by the Incas around the
      time the Spanish began taking over. The site was not rediscovered until 1911 by American
      historian Hiram Bingham. Since then, it has been declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary and
      allows tourists to see a glimpse of ancient Incan architecture.

    <p class="text">
        The best town to stay in to visit Machu Picchu is Aguas Calientes. The nearest airport is
      located in Cusco, which is a 3-4 hour train ride away from Aguas Calientes. Once in Aguas
      Calientes, you can reach Machu Picchu by either bus or foot. The trek to Machu Picchu from
      Aguas Calientes takes about 2-3 hours and is generally considered to be a difficult trail,
      but it is worth it if you have the extra time and are up for the challenge.

    <h4>Lima</h4>

      <img src="https://www.evolutiontreksperu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cathedral-of-Lima-1.png" class="peru_photo_right" alt="Cathedral"/>

      <p class="text">
        Lima is the capital city of Peru and likely the first place you will be after flying into the
      country as it is home to Peru’s largest international airport. While Machu Picchu is heavily
      centered around Peru’s indigenous culture, Lima is more influenced by Spanish culture, which
      is easily seen throughout the city. Located in downtown Lima, there are multiple breathtaking
      cathedrals, all free or extremely cheap to enter. The Basilica and Convent of San Francisco
      has catacombs that can be toured for 15 soles (about $4 USD).

    <p class="text">
        Besides the cathedrals, Lima has a spectacular food scene. Central, a restaurant in Lima,
      took the #1 spot on The World’s Best Restaurant 2023 list, sponsored by
      S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna; however, there is no need to spend vast amounts of money at an
      upscale restaurant to enjoy the delicious food Peru has to offer. There are numerous
      local restaurants scattered across Lima that offer fresh, home-cooked meals for cheap. You
      can also find street vendors selling things like anticuchos (marinated and grilled cow heart
      served on skewers) and picarones (a kind of Peruvian doughnut often eaten alongside anticuchos).
      For shopping, visit Lima’s shopping centers, such as Plaza San Miguel, Real Plaza Salaverry,
      or the beautiful Larcomar, which provides a stunning view of Lima’s coast.

    <p class="text">
        Punta Sal is a stunning coastal resort destination located in northern Peru, known for its
      warm, sunny beaches year-round. Its clear waters and rich marine biodiversity make it ideal
      for snorkeling, diving, and fishing. The area provides a relaxing atmosphere and is home to
      many luxurious resorts that can be considered budget-friendly compared to other countries
      due to the conversion rate from soles to USD. Punta Sal is ideal for those in search of a
      peaceful retreat while on a budget.

    <h4>Iquitos</h4>
    <div class="content_right">
    <img src="https://www.journeymachupicchu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IQUITO-1-1024x768.jpg" class="peru_photo_right" alt="Iquitos"/>

      <p>
        Iquitos is a vibrant city located in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, surrounded by lush
      rainforests and the Amazon River. Iquitos is a popular starting point for eco-tourism
      adventures due to the endless opportunities for jungle treks, wildlife watching, and river
      excursions. With the Amazon rainforest considered as one of the most biodiverse areas in the
      world, it is the perfect place to explore nature and encounter unique experiences.
      To get to Iquitos, you can either fly from the Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima
      into Iquitos, which takes approximately 1.5 hours, or if you’d like to be more adventurous,
      you can reach Iquitos by boat. To get there by boat, you will start your journey at either
      Pucallpa or Yurimaguas. Depending on where you start, the boat ride can take anywhere from 3
      to 7 days. Boat rides are typically hosted by cargo ships with hammocks for passengers to
      sleep in.

    <h5>General Tips</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Although many larger stores accept international credit/debit cards, it is best to use the
        money services within the airport to take out cash in soles.<br><br></li>
      <li>If your phone plan does not include international service, get an esim card in order to
        use your phone without Wi-Fi.<br><br></li>
      <li>If possible, learn basic phrases in Spanish to help you get around. Many people in tourist-
        heavy places know some English, but knowing a few common phrases in Spanish can help a lot.<br><br></li>
      <li>Most drinks do not come on ice. You have to request it.<br><br></li>
      <li>Carbonated water is extremely popular there, so look for "sin gas" on water bottles if you
        want uncarbonated water.<br><br></li>
      <li>Bring medicine if you have a sensitive stomach, especially if you are planning on eating
        at smaller local restaurants.<br><br></li>

    </ul>

  <h5>Safety</h5>
  <p>
    Safety for tourists in Peru can vary by region. In areas with heavy tourism, there is usually
    a strong police presence which makes it safer for tourists to roam fairly freely. However,
    it is crucial to be aware of your surroundings in crowded areas, such as downtown Lima, to
    avoid falling victim to petty crimes, such as pickpocketing. Try to not carry big bills.
    As a tourist, it is best to avoid public transportation as it poses additional risks. Make
    sure to call a registered taxi service for transportation since anyone is able to put a taxi
    sign on their car. While in the taxi it is best to have all your documents secure and your
    valuable out of sight. Attempting to rent a car, especially in Lima, is highly discouraged as
    traffic laws are not heavily enforced there, making driving extremely difficult if you are not
    accustomed to the traffic there.
    </p>
  <p>
    In more rural or less-traveled regions, it is recommended to travel with a guide, especially
    if you do not speak Spanish.
